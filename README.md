# BusMall

Simone Odegard
BusMall tracks clicks of users to see what items they like most. Items are randomized by a shuffle array. Results are shown by text and by a chart.

2/22 8:37pm Figured out the clicks and amounts!

2/23 3:14pm Cleaned up code to be easier to read. Added the button for results

2/23 6:30pm Made it so there are no repeats. Also added a graph that shows the clicks

2/24 5:10pm added the 4 steps of converting to json format, put on to local storage, got the items out of storage, and turned back into javascript. JB helped walk us through as we completed the project.
